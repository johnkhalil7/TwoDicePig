# TwoDicePig
Kotlin Two-Dice Pig application that supports PvP, first to 50 wins

# Rules:

Roll dice and the sum gets added to a turn total at the bottom of the screen

Can choose to hold, at which point the turn total gets added to your total score and it switches player turns or you can roll again to build up your turn total

If you roll a single one, your turn total is wiped and switches player turns

If you roll a snake-eyes, both your turn total and total score are reset to 0 and switches player

If you roll any other double, you cannot hold and must roll again
